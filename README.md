# Computational Musicology Portfolio

For the assignment for the course 'Computational Musicology' a portfolio will be created in order to perform various analyses relating to music.
This portfolio will mainly focus on music listening behavior of Spotify users globally, and in the Netherlands before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, whether music preferences have shifted during the pandemic and whether changes can be identified to the restrictions imposed by the Dutch government (e.g. lockdown and curfew).

### Corpus
In order to analyze general listening behavior, the corpus will be focus on the following variables:
* Geographic Region
* Playlist
* Spotify Audio features
* Time

#### Geographic Region
Since the portfolio will make comparisons between the Netherlands and the rest of the world geographic regions in the corpus will be the Netherlands and global.

#### Playlist
In order to keep track on the average listening behavior of Spotify users, the ‘Top 50’ and ‘Viral 50’ playlists will be analyzed over time per geographic region.

#### Genre
The changes (or lack thereof) listening behavior will be measured by the genre.

#### Time
The variable time will be used to identify periods before and during the pandemic that may explain the change of musical preferences as shown in the top and viral playlists. As well as help compare annual periods such as the December Holiday season before and during the pandemic.
